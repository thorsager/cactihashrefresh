cactihashrefresh
================

Small tool to update the hashes in a cacti template file.
Some time it is so much faster, exporting a cacti-template and editing it in
you text editor, and importing it as a new template. But for that to work, 
you have to change all the hashes in then templa, or it will just update the
exported template.

It can also updatethe version-tag of a cacti-template, should that be needed 
(for more info on the version numbers read the
http://docs.cacti.net/howto:determine_cacti_template_version document)
